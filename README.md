# Duelity
Final Project for Network Game Development
--------------------------------------------------------------

Duelity is a fun multiplayer game that allows players to test their ability to blend in with their 
environment while enjoying a sniper fight (Ideally). Players will be placed into a hosted lobby where two players
can ready up to start a match. Once you eliminate your target, you win the game so it'll be very important to not 
allow your opponent to find you first.
